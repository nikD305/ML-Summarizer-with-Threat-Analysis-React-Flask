Step 1: Create a folder and open it in visual studio code.

Step 2: open a new terminal in VS code and run this command to create a virtual environment:  py -3 -m venv .venv

Step 3: now run following command to activate virtual environment :  .venv\scripts\activate

Step 4: now go to --view -- command palette -- type Select Python Interpreter, from the list --select the virtual environment in your project folder that starts with ./.venv or .\.venv:
          Here intrepretor is where our pip imports are installed and we select the intreprator where we want to open, 
so if import did work then do the pip install in powershell



Step 5: Open a new terminal that will activate the newly created virtual environment, then 

Step 6: run the following command in the terminal: 
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Step 7: Install Flask in the virtual environment-run following command -
        python -m pip install flask





 Step 1: create a new file with the name, app.py and save it. 
 Step 2: Now we write the following lines of code in this file --
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__) 
  
 @app.route("/")
    def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"
  
 save the app.py file (Ctrl+S).
  
Step 3: Now Run the flask server by using a terminal with the command - 
        python -m flask run

which runs the Flask development server. The development server looks for app.py by default. 

   note: If you see an error that the Flask module cannot be found,
           then run the following command:  python -m pip install flask  
                                  and restart VS Code once.
     
Step 4: Also, if you want to run the development server on a different IP address or port, use the host and port command-line arguments, as with --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80.     
     
Step 5: Run the app from the browser.      

Step 6: Stop the app by using Ctrl+C in the terminal.
